[Ryan Dawidjan][ryan] put perfectly into words how I've been feeling about blogging.

I've always been a fan of the microblog services.

I loved Posterous (RIP, I was a college mobilizer for them), and still use tumblr. They are a nice medium (no pun intended) between polished blogging and tweeting.

Over the past two years, I constantly find myself revisiting my personal tagline.

> I'm a web developer (insert my ever-evolving interests, experiences, strengths, issues I care about, etc...).

I've wanted roll up microblogging + the ability to keep others updated on my interests and experiences.

I think Derek Sivers has nailed this with his [Now][now] movement.

I'm combining all of this in *Quickbytes*.
