Every few months I redo my website. I do this because I get sick of the style or the language on the site. Sometimes I want to show off a new skill, language, or style I've acquired.

I think it's painful because it's hard to jam yourself into a website. Naturally, we all want to portray the best version of ourselves. Whether it's because we value self-expression or because we want to sell work we create, we try and put our best (and most sincere) foot forward.

Maybe this is where writing comes in? Blogging serves as a place to share your evolving interests and experiences? I'm hoping I can kill some of that churn by writing more.
