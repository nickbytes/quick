In a recent meeting, a coworker talked about her time working in a call center.

She talked about use of "yes, and" language, as well as the ability to not say "no" early in a conversation.

Saying "no" early on in the conversation misaligned interests and created tension between the two parties. At the same time, it was important not to agree to everything the customer was seeking â€“ incase these were unreasonable for your business.

I was super interested in hearing more about the lessons call centers can teach people in tech or services, so I reached out to her. Turns out I wasn't the only one at the company interested in hearing more about this. Three of us are meeting next week (remote team, but we all happen to be in NYC) to chat about her experiences there. Should be awesome, will post what I learn.
